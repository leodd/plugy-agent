### Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Use pytest fixtures for shared test components
- Mock external services (especially OpenAI API)
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Verify correlation ID behavior in endpoint tests

### Commands

``bash
# Run all tests with Python 3.12
tox

# Run only linting
tox -e lint

# Run only type checking
tox -e typecheck

# Run tests with coverage reporting
tox -e coverage

# Run specific tests
tox -e specific -- tests/unit/test_middleware/test_correlation_id.py -v
```
